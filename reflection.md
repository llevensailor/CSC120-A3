Use this file to record your reflection on this assignment.

- Which classmates did you consult with while working on this assignment?
I talked through the transcript with Frankie and I talked to my stuffed dinosaur when I was coding by myself.
- Which session(s) of TA / office hours did you attend?
I attened Ab's Monday office hours. Most of the questions I was able to answer myself but I needed to ask the question outloud before I could figure out an answer. 
- What are your initial impressions of Java? 
I have experience with Java because I took AP Computer Science A so I am very comfortable with Java. 
- Can you draw any conclusion about programming in general from the similarities or the differences between the two languages? 
Java and Python are very similar in that they go about the same way to do things but Python seems to be a very stripped version of Java. My only experience with Python was our first coding experience. 
- What worked, what didn't, what advice would you give someone taking this course in the future?
I would advice someone to do what I did which was look at the small wins. I didn't focus on getting each part of the rubric to work all at once, I broke it into chunks and worked on specific parts. It took me a little to come up with the final equation for the number of elements in the transcript. I had trouble with mirroring at first but then I was able to fix my mistake easily and got it to work. My transcript worked from the beginning but it was skipping some of the inputs so it took me a little to figure out why and get everything that needed to be in it in the right order.
